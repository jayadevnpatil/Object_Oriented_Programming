# C++ OOPs Concepts Tutorial
Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. This repository contains detailed explanations and examples of various OOP concepts in C++. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

## 📚 Contents<br>

1. _**Classes**_<br>
    The [class](./01_class.cpp) covers the definition of a class, specifying a class, access specifiers, ways of writing class      definitions, and the difference between a class and an object.

2.  _**Access Specifiers**_ 🔒<br>
    The [access specifiers](02_aceses_specifiers.cpp) explains the concept of access specifiers in C++. It covers the definition of access specifiers, including `public`, `private`, and `protected`, and their roles in encapsulation and data hiding.

3.  _**Constructors**_ 🏗️<br>
    The [constructors](./03_constructors.cpp) explains the concept of constructors in C++. It covers the definition of constructors, their characteristics, types (`default`, `parameterized`, and `copy constructors`), and constructor overloading.<br>
    It also cover **member initialization list** which is a way to initialize class member variables directly within the constructor's definition.

4.  _**Destructors**_ 💥<br>
    The [destructors](04_destructors.cpp) provides an overview of destructors in C++, explaining their purpose, definition, characteristics, and syntax. It includes a basic structure example demonstrating how destructors are automatically invoked when objects go out of scope.
    
5.  _**Friend Functions and Friend Classes**_ 👫<br>
    The [friend functions and friend classes](./05_friend_function.cpp) explains the concept of friend functions in C++ which covers the definition of friend functions, their characteristics, usage, and declaration syntax. It also explains the concept of friend classes their definition and usage.

6.  _**Function Overloading**_ 🔄🏋<br>
    The [function_overloading](./06_function_overloading.cpp) showcases the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. It includes examples of function overloading with varying `parameter types, numbers, and return types`, illustrating how overloaded functions are resolved at compile time based on the arguments passed to them.

7.  _**Operator Overloading**_ ➕🏋🏾‍♀️<br>
    The [operator overloading](./07_operator_overloading.cpp) explains the types of operator overloading, including unary and binary overloading, and the ways to implement it both outside and inside classes/structures using normal functions, friend functions, and member functions. 

8.  _**Static Members**_ ⚡<br>
    The [static overloading](./08_static_members.cpp) presents static data members and static member functions, highlighting their characteristics such as shared existence, initialization, and access without object creation. 

## 🎓 Happy learning!
